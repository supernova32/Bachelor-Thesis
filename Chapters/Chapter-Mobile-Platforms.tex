Over the past few years competition between the different platform manufacturers has increased, leading to better products and features. In this chapter we will take a look at the most important players in mobile OS race, in alphabetical order.

\marginpar{\autoref{fig:trend} should give you an overview of the market share.}

\section{Android}
\spacedlowsmallcaps{Android} is a Linux based operating system specially designed for touchscreen devices like smartphones or tablets. It began as the brain-child of a new company called Android, Inc. back in 2003.

\begin{quotation}
Android, Inc. was founded in Palo Alto, California in October 2003 by Andy Rubin (co-founder of Danger), Rich Miner (co-founder of Wildfire Communications, Inc.), Nick Sears (once VP at T-Mobile), and Chris White (headed design and interface development at WebTV) to develop, in Rubin's words "smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's location and preferences". The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras, when it was realised that the market for the devices was not large enough, and diverted their efforts to producing a smartphone operating system to rival those of Symbian and Windows Mobile (Apple's iPhone had not been released at the time). Despite the past accomplishments of the founders and early employees, Android Inc. operated secretly, revealing only that it was working on software for mobile phones. That same year, Rubin ran out of money. Steve Perlman, a close friend of Rubin, brought him \$10,000 in cash in an envelope and refused a stake in the company.

\end{quotation}

Google bought Android, Inc. in 2005 and made it a wholly owned subsidiary. The most important employees stayed and started working on what later would become the Android Operating System.

Up until the release of the first Android Device on October \nth{22}, 2008, Google conducted secret meetings with many handset and chip manufacturers to discuss the creation of a new consortium, the Open Handset Alliance, with the goal to develop open standards for mobile devices. The Alliance was unveiled on November \nth{5}, 2007.\footnote{\url{http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/press_110507.html}}


After the first device with Android, the HTC Dream, was released there has been a major surge of devices using Android. Hardware manufacturers from all over the world have chosen Android as their favourite operating system, not only for smartphones and tablets but also for embedded devices like the Cotton Candy Stick\footnote{\url{http://www.fxitech.com/technology/for-android/}} from FXI Technologies and even for gaming consoles like the Ouya\footnote{\url{https://www.ouya.tv/discover/}}. %They have gone the Android route to give their devices a robust and secure operating system.


The development of system features and other components has been done at a steady pace, releasing new versions of the OS every couple of months. The team has chosen to give colourful names to each release, always in alphabetical order and always named after a dessert or a sweet treat. A closer look at \autoref{fig:android1} and \autoref{fig:android2} should give you a better overview over the different versions of Android and what each of them brought forth.

\subsection{The Android Open Source Project}
One of the best features and assets of Android is that it is 100\% Open Source. This allows everyone with the necessary knowledge to contribute to the development of the platform and also to modify it in every way you want.


This is exactly what the guys behind CyanogenMod have done. They took the regular Android Operating System and added many features and improvements to the core experience, making it the most popular unofficial Android OS.


But these types of modifications are not only common inside hobbyist communities, big corporations also contribute code to the Android Project. Some even modify the code so much, that it becomes almost unrecognisable. That is exactly what Amazon did. They took the Android OS and heavily modified it in order to install it in their Kindle Fire family of tablets.


Using an Open Source Model also guarantees Android an independent future from Google. Even if Google stops supporting \marginpar{Note: Google is unlikely to stop supporting Android} Android, the community will pick up the pieces and continue with its development and will guarantee its longevity.
 
\section{BlackBerry}
The Blackberry OS is proprietary mobile operating system developed by BlackBery Ltd\marginpar{Balckberry Ltd was until recently known as RIM (Research In Motion)} exclusively for its line of BlackBerry devices.

\begin{quotation}
The operating system provides multitasking and supports specialized input devices that have been adopted by BlackBerry Ltd. for use in its handhelds, particularly the trackwheel, trackball, and most recently, the trackpad and touchscreen.\\

The BlackBerry platform is perhaps best known for its native support for corporate email, through MIDP 1.0 and, more recently, a subset of MIDP 2.0, which allows complete wireless activation and synchronization with Microsoft Exchange, Lotus Domino, or Novell GroupWise email, calendar, tasks, notes, and contacts, when used with BlackBerry Enterprise Server. The operating system also supports WAP 1.2.\\

Updates to the operating system may be automatically available from wireless carriers that support the BlackBerry over the air software loading (OTASL) service.\\

Third-party developers can write software using the available BlackBerry API classes, although applications that make use of certain functionality must be digitally signed.

\section{iOS}
\spacedlowsmallcaps{iOS} is a Unix-based (BSD) mobile operating system designed by Apple exclusively for its mobile devices, the iPhone\textregistered{} and the iPad\textregistered.

\begin{quotation}
    The operating system was unveiled with the iPhone at the Macworld Conference \& Expo, January 9, 2007, and released in June of that year. At first, Apple marketing literature did not specify a separate name for the operating system, stating simply that the "iPhone runs OS X". Initially, third-party applications were not supported. Steve Jobs' reasoning was that developers could build web applications that "would behave like native apps on the iPhone". On October 17, 2007, Apple announced that a native Software Development Kit (SDK) was under development and that they planned to put it "in developers' hands in February". On March 6, 2008, Apple released the first beta, along with a new name for the operating system: "iPhone OS".
Apple had released the iPod Touch, which had most of the non-phone capabilities of the iPhone. Apple also sold more than one million iPhones during the 2007 holiday season. On January 27, 2010, Apple announced the iPad, featuring a larger screen than the iPhone and iPod Touch, and designed for web browsing, media consumption, and reading iBooks.
In June 2010, Apple rebranded iPhone OS as "iOS". The trademark "IOS" had been used by Cisco for over a decade for its operating system, IOS, used on its routers. To avoid any potential lawsuit, Apple licensed the "IOS" trademark from Cisco.
\cite{wikipedia:ios}
\end{quotation}

The history of iOS has been very straight forward, there haven't been any complications and a new version has been unveiled every year. Unlike Google, Apple doesn't use code-names for every version of iOS, they just carry their version number. You can take a look at \autoref{fig:ios} for a more detailed description of every iOS version released until now.

\subsection{Jailbreaking}
The very strict guidelines and restrictions imposed by Apple on their mobile operating system have led to many developers and hackers to develop ways to circumvent them and use their rightfully owned devices to their full potential. This method is called \emph{Jailbreaking} \marginpar{Jailbreak: In other words, release their devices from the fictional jail imposed by Apple.} and it give users access to many features that are present in Android devices, but either Apple has decided to block them or Apple allows the service providers to block them. The most notorious example in this particular area is Internet Sharing. 


In the United States, for example, Verizon blocks access to a system setting that allows you to share the mobile internet access of the device with other wireless devices, unless you pay an extra fee.\footnote{\url{http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/how-i-share-my-iphones-internet-connection-without-paying-verizon-extra/}} This feature can also be blocked on Android devices, but unlike Apple, Google does allow applications that let you share your internet access into its store. Apple just blocks them. The only way around it, is to jailbreak your device.

The reason I mention this topic here is that it has become a really important issue, specially surrounding user rights. There have been     

\section{Windows Phone}
\section{Other platforms worth noting}
The platforms mentioned above are the most popular ones. Together they control around 95\% of the mobile market, however, there are companies like Mozilla and Cononical that want to enter the competition and bring forth completely new ideas on what a mobile operating system should be.

\subsection{Firefox OS}
\spacedlowsmallcaps{Firefox OS} is Mozilla's entry to the mobile market. It hopes to revolutionise the mobile ecosystem by proposing that all applications for the device be programmed using Web Technologies.

\begin{quotation}
On July 25, 2011, Dr. Andreas Gal, Director of Research at Mozilla Corporation, announced the "Boot to Gecko" Project (B2G) on the mozilla.dev.platform mailing list. The project proposal was to "pursue the goal of building a complete, standalone operating system for the open web" in order to "find the gaps that keep web developers from being able to build apps that are – in every way – the equals of native apps built for the iPhone [iOS], Android, and WP7 [Windows Phone 7]." The announcement identified these work areas: new web APIs to expose device and OS capabilities such as telephone and camera, a privilege model to safely expose these to web pages, applications to prove these capabilities, and low-level code to boot on an Android-compatible device.
This led to much blog coverage. According to Ars Technica, "Mozilla says that B2G is motivated by a desire to demonstrate that the standards-based open Web has the potential to be a competitive alternative to the existing single-vendor application development stacks offered by the dominant mobile operating systems."
\cite{wikipedia:firefox}
\end{quotation}

In 2012 B2G was rebranded as Firefox OS in honour of the company's flagship product, the Firefox Web Browser.


Some preview units have been shipped to journalists and developers, in order to gain some traction, but the system has not come to production, yet. 

\begin{quotation}
In February 2013, Mozilla announced plans for global commercial roll-out of Firefox OS. Mozilla announced at a press conference before the start of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that the first wave of Firefox OS devices will be available to consumers in Brazil, Colombia, Hungary, Mexico, Montenegro, Poland, Serbia, Spain and Venezuela. Firefox have also announced that LG Electronics, ZTE, Huawei and TCL Corporation have committed to making Firefox OS devices.

\subsection{Ubuntu Phone}
\spacedlowsmallcaps{Ubuntu Phone} is Conical's horse in the mobile race. With it, Canonical hopes to disturb the mobile market by offering a single operating system capable of being a Mobile OS and a Desktop OS. As Canonical's own website puts it, 

\begin{quotation}
High-end smartphones have a brain as powerful as ultra-light laptops. Ubuntu uniquely enables a new category of convergence device – phones that dock to become full PCs and thin clients; enabling enterprise IT departments to replace phones, thin clients and laptops with a single secure corporate device.\\

Operators targeting the enterprise market with LTE can now deliver a full laptop/phone solution, with Windows apps delivered over LTE from the corporate data center. And operators in emerging markets can deliver desktop applications to the converged device over LTE as a premium data service.\footnote{\url{http://www.ubuntu.com/phone/operators-and-oems}}
\end{quotation}


\spacedlowsmallcaps{Ubuntu Phone} is still in the early stages of development, but has already gained the backing of major OEM's and carriers around the world. Once it hits the market, it will become the next player to watch, doubtlessly bringing new ideas and features to the table.
