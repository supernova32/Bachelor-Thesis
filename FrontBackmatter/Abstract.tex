\chapter*{Abstract}
This work is divided into 4 parts that are preceded by an introduction and a glance at the history of \emph{MHM Systemhaus GmbH}, the company that kindly gave me the opportunity to write this paper and develop a mobile application for their eRecruiting Service.

In \spacedlowsmallcaps{Part 1} we will take a brief look into the history of mobile computing itself and of the currently available platforms. We will also discuss some of the distribution and development challenges that a multi-platform application has to face, before being published. 

\spacedlowsmallcaps{Part 2} will focus on the steps it takes to design a mobile application, the possibilities for multi-platform development and the challenges one has to consider when choosing the best approach and framework for cross-platform development. It will also evaluate two of the most popular frameworks based on our requirements and as a result will give us the best framework for us to use in the development of our mobile application.

In \spacedlowsmallcaps{Part 3} we will discuss what the cloud actually is and how we can optimize a service to create a seamless connection to a mobile device. We also will review the challenges one has to consider in order to securely connect an application to a cloud service and the different communication types that are available to us.

Finally, \spacedlowsmallcaps{Part 4} will collect all of the topics previously discussed and will focus on the development of a real world application using a specially designed Rails Server Application that connects to the MHM eRecruiting Systems and acts as cloud service.
