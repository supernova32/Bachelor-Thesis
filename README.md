#Design and Implementation of Cloud Connected Mobile Applications

##What is it about?

Well, this repository contains the tex files for my Bachelor's Thesis from the University of
Applied Sciences in Stuttgart, Germany.

It focuses on the challenges of developing a multi-platform mobile applications and the
steps one needs to take connect such an application to a cloud based service.

We wanted to develop a cloud service and a mobile application that connects to it. 
For the cloud service we developed a Rails API Server that handles search \& push notifications and for the app,
we decided to program it with multi-platform technologies. We chose Xamarin as the framework for this endeavour.
